	I would like to thank my family for their relentless support and guidance. I would also like to thank my advisor Dr. Henok Mulugeta for reviewing my research title.  I thank my dear friend Kine Tibebu for an insightful discussion about the research matter. Finally and most importantly I thank my dearest and beloved Finot Mebratu, simply speaking what would I do without you.
