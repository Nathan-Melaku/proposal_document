	\noindent Steganographic algorithms are mainly evaluated by their security. Traditional steganographic frameworks used different embedding algorithms to achieve this goal. This means, embedding the secret message directly to a cover image. Nonetheless, with the development of sophisticated machine learning based steganalysis algorithms even the slightest modifications can be detected. This has triggered a lot of researchers to pursue coverless steganography. In my thesis, I will design and implement a generative steganography framework using the state of the art \gls{GAN}.The main goal is to improve the quality of the generated stego images without compromising the security.
