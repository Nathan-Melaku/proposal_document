	abstract = {This book covers newly developed and novel Steganography techniques and algorithms. The book outlines techniques to provide security to a variety of applications using Steganography, with the goal of both hindering an adversary from decoding a hidden message, and also preventing an adversary from suspecting the existence of covert communications. The book looks into applying these newly designed and improved algorithms to provide a new and efficient Steganographic system, called Characteristic Region-Based Image Steganography (CR-BIS). The algorithms combine both the robustness of the Speeded-Up Robust Features technique (SURF) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to achieve characteristic region Steganography synchronization. The book also touches on how to avoid hiding data in the whole image by dynamically selecting characteristic regions for the process of embedding. •Applies and discusses innovative techniques for hiding text in a digital image file or even using it as a key to the encryption; •Provides a variety of methods to achieve characteristic region Steganography synchronization; •Shows how Steganography improves upon cryptography by using obscurity features.},

To address this problem, a novel coverless information hiding method based on generative adversarial networks is proposed in this paper. The main idea of the method is that the class label of generative adversarial networks is replaced with the secret information as a driver to generate hidden image directly. And the secret information is extracted from the hidden image through a discriminator. Experimental results show that this hidden algorithm ensures good performs in terms of steganography capacity, anti-steganalysis and safety.},

The message is written to the corrupted region that needs to be filled in the corrupted image in advance. Then the corrupted image with secret message is fed into a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for semantic completion. The adversarial game not only reconstruct the corrupted image, but also generate a stego image which contains the logic rationality of image content.

@article{Wu2018,
	abstract = {In many domains of computer vision, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved great success, among which the family of Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) is considered to be state-of-the-art due to the theoretical contributions and competitive qualitative performance. However, it is very challenging to approximate the k-Lipschitz constraint required by the Wasserstein-1 metric (W-met). In this paper, we propose a novel Wasserstein divergence (W-div), which is a relaxed version of W-met and does not require the k-Lipschitz constraint. As a concrete application, we introduce a Wasserstein divergence objective for GANs (WGAN-div), which can faithfully approximate W-div through optimization. Under various settings, including progressive growing training, we demonstrate the stability of the proposed WGAN-div owing to its theoretical and practical advantages over WGANs. Also, we study the quantitative and visual performance of WGAN-div on standard image synthesis benchmarks, showing the superior performance of WGAN-div compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

@article{Jolicoeur-Martineau2019,
	abstract = {In standard generative adversarial network (SGAN), the discriminator D estimates the probability that the input data is real. The generator G is trained to increase the probability that fake data is real. We argue that it should also simultaneously decrease the probability that real data is real because 1) this would account for a priori knowledge that half of the data in the mini-batch is fake, 2) this would be observed with divergence minimization, and 3) SGAN would be more similar to integral probability metric (IPM) GANs. We show that this property can be induced by using a “relativistic discriminator” which estimate the probability that the given real data is more realistic than a randomly sampled fake data. We also present a variant in which the discriminator estimate the probability that the given real data is more realistic than fake data, on average. We generalize both approaches to non-standard GAN loss functions and we refer to them respectively as Relativistic GANs (RGANs) and Relativistic average GANs (RaGANs). We show that IPM-based GANs are a subset of RGANs which use the identity function. Empirically, we observe that 1) RGANs and RaGANs are significantly more stable and generate higher quality data samples than their non-relativistic counterparts, 2) Standard RaGAN with gradient penalty generate data of better quality than WGAN-GP while only requiring a single discriminator update per generator update (reducing the time taken for reaching the state-of-the-art by 400{\%}), and 3) RaGANs are able to generate plausible high resolutions images (256x256) from a very small sample (N=2011), while GAN and LSGAN cannot; these images are of significantly better quality than the ones generated by WGAN-GP and SGAN with spectral normalization.

	abstract = {Boundary equilibrium generative adversarial networks (BEGANs) can generate impressively realistic face images, but there is a trade-off between the quality and the diversity of generated images. Based on BEGANs, we propose an effective approach to generate images with higher quality and better diversity. By adding a second loss function (a denoising loss) to the discriminator, the discriminator can learn more useful information about the distribution of real images. Naturally, the ability of discriminator in distinguishing between real and generated images is improved, which further guides the generator to produce more realistic images to confuse the discriminator. We also find that using technique of batch normalization in BEGANs architecture can improve the diversity of generated images. By using batch normalization and adding a denoising loss to the objective of discriminator, we achieve comparative generations on CIFAR-10 and CelebA data sets. In addition, we evaluate the effect of several techniques on BEGANs framework through 'Inception-Score', a measure which has been found to correlate well with human assessment of generated samples.},
