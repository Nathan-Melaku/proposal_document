	\section{Budget}
	The only budget requirement for this research is the cost of training machine. Since this research is being conducted in the field of deep learning, It requires the use of very high performance computers with \gls{GPU}s. If the university have such computer in the lab, I will ask for permission to use it. However if I could not get my hand on such a machine at this university, I will use a cloud service. There are many cloud providers for machine learning research computers. Some of them are AWS E2 of amazon, and Google cloud which have fair price range. In total I will be spending less than 20,000 birr. If I could find a sponsor I will be glad to accept. Nevertheless, In the worst case scenario I will cover the cost by my self.
