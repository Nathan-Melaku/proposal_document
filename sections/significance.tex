	\section{Significance Of The Study}
	Generative steganography from its conception has evolved a lot. Most recent studies focus on devising a novel plan rather than improving on previously proposed frameworks. However this research does not propose a novel framework to address the issues raised in the field. It aims at improving a previously proposed framework by utilizing recent advancements in the underlining technology, namely \gls{GAN}. 
	
	This research will have a good influence in the field by addressing one of the main drawback of generative steganography that is a core concept of the field of steganography by itself, which is imperceptibility. This concept is described in \ref{reqStego}. In short it describes the quality of steganography at hiding information in plain sight.
